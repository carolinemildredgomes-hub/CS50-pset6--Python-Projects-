# CS50-pset6--Python-Projects-
My CS50 Problem Set 6  solution for Python Projects 

This repository contains my solutions to **CS50x Problem Set 6 (Sentimental)**, where we re-implement earlier C programs in **Python** using the [`cs50`](https://pypi.org/project/cs50/) library.

Each program demonstrates Pythonic approaches to classic CS50 problems, including control flow, loops, string manipulation, greedy algorithms, and file I/O.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Install Python and the CS50 library:
   ```bash
   pip install cs50
üß© Projects
1. Hello (hello.py)

Prompts the user for their name.

Prints hello, name.

2. Mario Less (mario_less.py)

Prompts for a height (1‚Äì8).

Prints a left-aligned half-pyramid.

3. Mario More (mario_more.py)

Prompts for a height (1‚Äì8).

Prints a full pyramid with two sides.

4. Cash (cash.py)

Prompts for a dollar amount.

Outputs the minimum number of coins needed (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).

5. Credit (credit.py)

Implements the Luhn algorithm.

Identifies whether a credit card number is VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX, or INVALID.

6. Readability (readability.py)

Prompts for a block of text.

Outputs the grade level of the text using the Coleman‚ÄìLiau index.

7. DNA (dna.py)

Reads a DNA sequence and database of STR counts.

Identifies the individual matching the DNA profile or prints No match.
